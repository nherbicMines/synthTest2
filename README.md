# synthTest2
As WD-40 stands for "Water Displacement-40th Attempt", synthTest2 represents synthTest-3rd attempt

This is my attempt at programming a Synth utilizing SFML and Javidx9's noiseMaker header. The olcNoiseMaker.h is an open source tool for communicating between the program and the user's sound devices. SFML is the library I have chosen to design my GUI through SFML. Any .cpp or .h file not titled "olcNoiseMaker.h" is entirely my own code.

To run, download all files from the github and run synthTest2.exe in the Release folder. The keys are all labeled. By default, each one will produce a standard sin wave at a specific frequency. Holding shift and pressing the keys will produce a box sin wave instead for an 8-bit like effect.
