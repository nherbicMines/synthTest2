# synthTest2
As WD-40 stands for "Water Displacement-40th Attempt", synthTest2 represents synthTest-3rd attempt

This is my attempt at programming a Synth utilizing SFML and Javidx9's noiseMaker header. The olcNoiseMaker.h is an open source tool for communicating between the program and the user's sound devices. SFML is the library I have chosen to design my GUI through SFML. Any .cpp or .h file not titled "olcNoiseMaker.h" is entirely my own code.
